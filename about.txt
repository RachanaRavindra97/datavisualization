Cancer is a disease that affects a large population. The cause to this disease remains unknown. 
It is thought that there are several factors that influence the cause.
In this dashboard, I am representing a data set which contains information about a group of individuals enrolled to an experiment. It has information about the individual's lifestyle, other health factors and about if they have cancer or not. In case of individual's with cancer, it also taks about the type of cancer present.
